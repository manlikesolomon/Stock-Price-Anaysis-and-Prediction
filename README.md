## Introduction

In this project, we delve into Tesla's historical stock price data to gain insights and develop a predictive model. Predicting stock price movements is a complex task, and this project serves as an educational and exploratory effort into the world of financial analysis and machine learning.

## Data

We sourced historical Tesla stock price data using the yfinance python library, spanning from inception to date. The dataset includes various attributes such as Open, Close, High, Low prices, trading volumes, and more. It provides a rich foundation for our analysis and model development.

## Analysis

Our analysis section explores the historical trends and patterns in Tesla's stock price. We visualize key metrics, perform statistical analyses, and identify important factors that may influence the stock's movements.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial step in developing effective machine learning models for stock price prediction. In this repository, we detail the techniques used to create meaningful features from the raw data. These engineered features serve as inputs to our predictive model.

## Machine Learning Model

We have developed a machine learning model for predicting whether Tesla's stock price will rise or fall on the next trading day. The model is built using python's Scikit-learn library, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also discuss strategies for model validation and potential improvements.
